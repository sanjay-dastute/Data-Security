### Security Hardening Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure comprehensive security:

- [ ] Implement defense-in-depth strategy with multiple security layers
- [ ] Apply the principle of least privilege for all user accounts
- [ ] Regularly update and patch all system components
- [ ] Implement network segmentation for sensitive components
- [ ] Configure proper backup and disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Conduct regular security awareness training for all users
- [ ] Implement proper change management procedures
- [ ] Regularly test incident response procedures

### Common Security Misconfigurations

Avoid these common security mistakes:

- Using default credentials or weak passwords
- Disabling MFA for administrator accounts
- Implementing overly permissive network access rules
- Neglecting regular security audits and reviews
- Storing encryption keys in the same location as encrypted data
- Failing to properly configure breach detection mechanisms
- Neglecting to monitor system logs
- Implementing security by obscurity rather than strong controls
- Failing to test recovery procedures
- Neglecting to update security configurations as threats evolve
