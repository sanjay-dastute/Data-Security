# QuantumTrust Data Security - Functionality Guide

## Core Features

### Quantum-Resistant Encryption

QuantumTrust uses post-quantum cryptographic algorithms to protect data against future quantum computing threats:

- CRYSTALS-Kyber for key encapsulation
- CRYSTALS-Dilithium for digital signatures
- AES-256 for data encryption

Users can selectively encrypt specific fields within their data, providing granular control over security.

### Blockchain Key Management

All encryption keys are managed through a permissioned Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network:

- Immutable logging of key creation and usage
- Secure key storage
- Transparent key history

### No Data Retention

QuantumTrust operates as a pre-storage encryption bridge:

- Data is processed in memory
- No persistent storage of unencrypted data
- Temporary data is securely deleted after processing

### High-Performance Encryption

The system is designed to handle data of any size:

- Apache Kafka for asynchronous processing
- Apache Spark for batch processing of large datasets
- Redis caching for key lookups

### User-Friendly Dashboards

Role-specific dashboards provide intuitive interfaces:

- Admin: System-wide management and monitoring
- Org Admin: Organization-specific management
- Org User: Individual user operations

## Advanced Features
