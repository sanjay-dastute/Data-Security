# QuantumTrust Data Security - Application Overview

## System Architecture

QuantumTrust Data Security is a comprehensive data security solution designed to provide advanced encryption using quantum-resistant algorithms and blockchain technology. The system architecture consists of the following components:

### Backend (NestJS)

The backend is built using NestJS, a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications. It provides:

- GraphQL API for flexible queries
- REST API for simple endpoints
- Authentication and authorization
- Encryption services
- Key management
- Logging and auditing

### Frontend (Next.js)

The frontend is built using Next.js, a React framework for production-grade applications. It provides:

- Role-specific dashboards (Admin, Org Admin, Org User)
- File management interface
- Encryption settings
- Key management interface
- Activity tracking
- Audit logs

### Blockchain (Hyperledger Fabric)

The blockchain component is built using Hyperledger Fabric, a permissioned blockchain platform. It provides:

- Immutable logging of encryption events
- Secure key management
- Decentralized key recovery

### Databases

- PostgreSQL: Stores structured data (users, organizations, keys)
- MongoDB: Stores unstructured logs
- Redis: Caches key lookups

### Message Brokers

- Apache Kafka: Handles asynchronous event processing
- Apache Spark: Processes large datasets

## Data Flow

1. User uploads data through the frontend or API
2. Data is temporarily stored for field selection
3. Selected fields are encrypted using quantum-resistant algorithms
4. Encryption events are logged in the blockchain
5. Encrypted data is sent to the configured storage destination
6. Temporary data is deleted after processing

## Security Features

- Quantum-resistant encryption (CRYSTALS-Kyber, CRYSTALS-Dilithium)
- AES-256 for data encryption
- Blockchain-based key management
- Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration
- IP/MAC address verification
- Multi-factor authentication
- Self-destructing data on breach
- Decentralized key recovery

## Deployment Options

- Multi-cloud support (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Hybrid deployment
- Kubernetes orchestration
