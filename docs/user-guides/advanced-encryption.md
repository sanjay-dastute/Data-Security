## Quantum-Resistant Encryption

QuantumTrust uses post-quantum cryptographic algorithms that are resistant to attacks from quantum computers.

### Available Algorithms

- **CRYSTALS-Kyber**: For key encapsulation (generating and sharing encryption keys)
- **CRYSTALS-Dilithium**: For digital signatures (verifying the authenticity of encrypted data)
- **AES-256**: For symmetric encryption (the actual data encryption)

### How to Select Algorithms

1. During the encryption process, click "Advanced Settings"
2. Under "Encryption Algorithms," you can select:
   - Default (recommended for most users)
   - Custom (for specific requirements)
3. If selecting "Custom," choose your preferred algorithms for:
   - Key encapsulation
   - Digital signatures
   - Symmetric encryption
4. Click "Apply" to save your selections

## Timer-Based Key Regeneration

This feature automatically rotates your encryption keys after a specified period, enhancing security.

### Setting Up Timer-Based Keys

1. Go to "Keys" in the main menu
2. Select a key or create a new one
3. Click "Set Timer"
4. Configure:
   - Rotation period (hours, days, weeks, months)
   - Notification settings (when to alert you before rotation)
   - Auto-approval or manual approval for rotation
5. Click "Save Timer Settings"

### Managing Timer-Based Keys

- View countdown timers in the "Keys" section
- Receive notifications before key rotation
- Approve or reschedule pending rotations
- View rotation history for audit purposes

## Regulatory Compliance Templates

QuantumTrust provides pre-configured templates for various regulatory requirements.

### Available Templates

- **GDPR**: European data protection regulations
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare data protection (US)
- **PCI DSS**: Payment card industry standards
- **CCPA/CPRA**: California privacy regulations
- **Custom**: Create your own compliance template

### Using Compliance Templates

1. During the encryption process, click "Compliance Settings"
2. Select the appropriate regulatory template
3. The system will automatically:
   - Select required fields for encryption
   - Apply appropriate encryption algorithms
   - Configure necessary logging and auditing
   - Set appropriate access controls
4. Review the settings and make any additional adjustments
5. Proceed with encryption

## Batch Processing

For large datasets or multiple files, batch processing allows efficient encryption operations.

### Creating a Batch Job

1. Go to "Encryption" > "Batch Processing"
2. Click "New Batch Job"
3. Configure the job:
   - Upload multiple files or select a data source
   - Set encryption parameters (algorithms, fields, etc.)
   - Schedule the job (immediate or future time)
   - Configure resource allocation (for very large datasets)
4. Click "Create Job"

### Monitoring Batch Jobs

1. Go to "Encryption" > "Batch Processing" > "Job Status"
2. View:
   - Job progress (percentage complete)
   - Estimated completion time
   - Resource usage
   - Any errors or warnings
3. You can pause, resume, or cancel jobs in progress
4. Completed jobs show summary statistics and output locations

## Self-Destructing Data

This feature adds an extra layer of security by enabling data to self-destruct when accessed under unauthorized conditions.

### Configuring Self-Destruct

1. During encryption, click "Advanced Settings" > "Self-Destruct"
2. Configure triggers:
   - Access from unauthorized IP/MAC addresses
   - Access outside permitted timeframes
   - Multiple failed authentication attempts
   - Suspicious access patterns
3. Configure actions:
   - Delete data on unauthorized system
   - Notify administrators
   - Log the breach attempt
4. Click "Apply Self-Destruct Settings"

### Important Notes on Self-Destruct

- Self-destruct only removes data from the unauthorized system
- Original data remains intact on authorized systems
- All self-destruct events are logged for security analysis
- Test self-destruct functionality in a controlled environment first

## Multi-Cloud Storage

QuantumTrust supports storing encrypted data across multiple cloud providers for redundancy and compliance.

### Configuring Multi-Cloud Storage

1. Go to "Settings" > "Storage Configuration"
2. Click "Add Storage Provider"
3. Select from supported providers:
   - AWS S3
   - Azure Blob Storage
   - Google Cloud Storage
   - Local storage
4. Enter the required credentials and configuration
5. Set storage rules:
   - Primary/secondary designation
   - Data types for each provider
   - Geographical restrictions
   - Replication settings
6. Click "Save Storage Configuration"

### Using Multi-Cloud Storage

1. During encryption, select "Storage Options"
2. Choose:
   - Specific provider
   - Multi-cloud (using your configured rules)
   - Compliance-based (automatically selects based on data type)
3. The system will handle the distribution of data according to your settings
