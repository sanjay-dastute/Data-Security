# QuantumTrust Data Security - Troubleshooting Guide

This guide provides solutions for common issues you might encounter while using QuantumTrust Data Security.

## Authentication Issues

### Unable to Log In

**Symptoms:**
- Login fails with "Invalid credentials" message
- Unable to access the dashboard after entering credentials

**Possible Causes:**
1. Incorrect username or password
2. Account is locked or disabled
3. MFA verification failed
4. IP/MAC address not approved

**Solutions:**
1. Verify your username and password
2. Check if your account is active with your administrator
3. Ensure your MFA device is synchronized correctly
4. Request IP/MAC approval from your organization admin

### MFA Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Unable to receive or enter MFA codes
- "Invalid code" error when entering MFA verification

**Possible Causes:**
1. Time synchronization issues on your device
2. MFA app not properly set up
3. Network connectivity issues

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure your device's time is correctly synchronized
2. Verify the MFA setup in your authenticator app
3. Contact your administrator to reset MFA if necessary

## Encryption Issues

### Encryption Process Fails

**Symptoms:**
- Error message during encryption process
- Process hangs or times out

**Possible Causes:**
1. Data format not supported
2. File size exceeds limits
3. Selected fields not found in data
4. System resource constraints

**Solutions:**
1. Verify data format is supported (JSON, CSV, etc.)
2. For large files, use batch processing
3. Check field names match exactly
4. Try processing during off-peak hours

### Slow Encryption Performance

**Symptoms:**
- Encryption takes longer than expected
- System becomes unresponsive during encryption

**Possible Causes:**
1. Large dataset size
2. Network latency
3. System resource constraints
4. Concurrent processing limits

**Solutions:**
1. Use batch processing for large datasets
2. Check network connectivity
3. Verify system resources are adequate
4. Schedule large encryption jobs during off-peak hours

## Key Management Issues

### Key Generation Fails

**Symptoms:**
- Error message during key generation
- Keys not appearing in the key list

**Possible Causes:**
1. HSM connectivity issues
2. Insufficient permissions
3. System resource constraints

**Solutions:**
1. Check HSM connection status
2. Verify your role permissions
3. Contact your administrator

### Key Recovery Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Unable to recover keys
- Missing key shards

**Possible Causes:**
1. Insufficient key shards available
2. Incorrect shard information
3. MFA verification failed

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure you have the required number of key shards
2. Verify shard information is correct
3. Complete MFA verification
4. Contact your administrator for assistance

## Storage Configuration Issues

### Storage Connection Fails

**Symptoms:**
- Error connecting to configured storage
- Timeout during storage operations

**Possible Causes:**
1. Incorrect storage credentials
2. Network connectivity issues
3. Storage service unavailable
4. Permission issues

**Solutions:**
1. Verify storage credentials in settings
2. Check network connectivity to storage service
3. Confirm storage service is operational
4. Verify permissions on storage resources

### Data Not Appearing in Storage

**Symptoms:**
- Encryption completes but data not found in storage
- Partial data in storage

**Possible Causes:**
1. Storage path configuration incorrect
2. Write permissions issues
3. Storage quota exceeded

**Solutions:**
1. Verify storage path configuration
2. Check write permissions
3. Verify storage quota availability

## API Integration Issues

### API Authentication Fails

**Symptoms:**
- 401 or 403 errors from API
- "Invalid API key" messages

**Possible Causes:**
1. Incorrect API key
2. API key expired or revoked
3. Missing required headers

**Solutions:**
1. Verify API key is correct
2. Generate a new API key
3. Ensure all required headers are included in requests

### API Requests Timeout

**Symptoms:**
- Requests take too long to complete
- Connection timeout errors

**Possible Causes:**
1. Large data payload
2. Network latency
3. Server processing constraints

**Solutions:**
1. Break large requests into smaller chunks
2. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
3. Check network connectivity

## System Health Issues

### High CPU or Memory Usage

**Symptoms:**
- System performance degradation
- Dashboard shows high resource utilization

**Possible Causes:**
1. Concurrent encryption processes
2. Large dataset processing
3. Background tasks (backups, key rotation)

**Solutions:**
1. Schedule resource-intensive tasks during off-peak hours
2. Increase system resources if possible
3. Optimize batch processing configuration

### Database Connection Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Error messages related to database connectivity
- Slow query performance

**Possible Causes:**
1. Database service unavailable
2. Connection pool exhaustion
3. Query optimization issues

**Solutions:**
1. Verify database service status
2. Check connection pool configuration
3. Optimize database queries
4. Contact your administrator
